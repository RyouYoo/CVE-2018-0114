# CVE-2018-0114
Exploitation of a vulnerability in Cisco's node-jose, a JavaScript library created to manage JWT.

This vulnerability in Cisco's node-jose allows an attacker to forge malicious tokens.

JWT allows users to embed public keys (using the jwk value) inside the header of the token. However, the application should never trust those keys as an attacker can provide his own key and sign the message using the corresponding private key.
